<h3> Assignment Phase 1 for 3813ICT <h3>

Current components: account, chat and login

Plans for login: 
For there to be backend process that takes user input and checks it against database of existing users, then it takes you to account page filled with the valid user's account details

Plans for account:
For the website to display user's account details, including role and groups they are part of, then allow them to navigate to those groups via hyperlinks

Plans for chat:
Having a functioning chat that displays messages in real time, and giving special permissions depending on who is logged in

What is functioning:
CSS works as intended
Navigation bar is consistent and works as intended
Session storage is working as intended

In the future, I hope to at least have a functioning chat room and various groups with various permissions for different users. For this, I need to allow backend and frontend to communicate. Attempts towards this can be seen in the code, they are commented out because they didn't function as planned. I will do research and ask questions, and make sure it functions for the second phase.
